# Jupyter-Notebook-for-Kaggle-s-Titanic-Challenge: 
The famous website Kaggle has a beginner's challenge : predict survival of a list of Titanic passengers, based ona  training data (a different list with the survival 
known). 
I upload here my solution using Jupyter Notebook. 
My highest Kaggle for this challenge was 0.767. For a higher score, more data engineering would be needed. [titanic_solution.pdf](https://github.com/Catalin-Ioan-Sapariuc/Jupyter-Notebook-for-Kaggle-s-Titanic-Challenge/files/6754754/titanic_solution.pdf)
